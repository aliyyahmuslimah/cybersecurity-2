Practical 2 (BAB 2) — Steps C1–C2: the Caesar cipher, build it then break it (STARTER).

WARNING: Caesar is a TOY cipher. It is used here only to be attacked; never use it to
protect data. The practical's rule still stands: in real work you use a standard library
(e.g. AES-GCM), not a cipher you invented.

C1  Fill in caesar_encrypt and caesar_decrypt:
      - only the letters A-Z and a-z are shifted; upper/lower case is preserved
      - digits, spaces, punctuation and non-ASCII letters do NOT change
      - negative shifts and shifts >= 26 are normalised (shift 27 equals shift 1)
C2  Fill in brute_force: return the 25 key guesses (1..25) as a list of
    (shift, decrypted_text). Then read artifacts/caesar_message.txt, run brute_force, and
    find the one candidate that reads as a sentence. Record: how large is Caesar's keyspace,
    and compare it with AES-256 (2**256).

Expected output once finished (python3 1_symmetric/starter/c1_caesar.py):
    round-trip: True
    keyspace: 25
    ... 25 candidate lines, one of which is a readable English sentence
